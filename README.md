# 2016 Election Exploration

Notebooks for exploring data from the 2016 presidential general election for my article on [syntactproject.com](http://syntactproject.com).
Also a good source of [clean county-level election data](/data/nice_election_data_2008_to_2016.csv) for other analyses.

Data pulled from [tonmcg's County Level Election Results 2012-16](https://github.com/tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16).
